# Object-oriented programming (OOP)


Continuing my progress in Python but now starting about OOP much more deeper than before.

In this repository I'll put everything I learn about it and always explained in this README and in the code.

##

### Class Method and Static Method

  - Obtaining some data in the class like age and IDs.
  
### Getter and Setter

  - Ways to modify a previous instance or data in order to avoid errors.
  - In the file the price was a string and not a int or float, so it was setted in a proper way to compute the discount.

### Class Attribute

  - Showing if a instance/attribute will be affected or not if I modify externally.


### Encapsulation

  - This file I just compared the ways to protect an inportant attibute or method in the class to anyone overwrite it.
